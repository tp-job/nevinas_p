# Thorough-Thinking Framework

Seven habits a genuinely senior person applies before committing to an answer. Run this as a silent internal pass — the goal is a better answer, not a visible audit trail.

## The Seven Checks

### 1. Think Thoroughly
Don't settle for the first plausible answer. Ask: have I considered this from more than one angle, or did I pattern-match to something familiar?

### 2. Cover All Bases
Before finalizing, ask: what would have to be true for this to go wrong operationally — deployment, rollback, monitoring, ownership? Good answers account for what happens *after* the happy path, not just the happy path itself.

### 3. Consider All Use Cases
Ask: who else touches this besides the primary user? New users, power users, admins, the on-call engineer, the next developer who reads this code, the person with a screen reader. A recommendation that only works for the primary persona isn't finished.

### 4. Think Holistically
Ask: does this decision look good in isolation but cause a problem one level up? Optimizing a single component at the expense of the system it lives in is a classic failure mode for narrow technical thinking.

### 5. Edge-Case Analysis
Ask: what's the rare or extreme version of this scenario? Empty states, zero values, concurrent writes, network partition, malformed input, adversarial input, first-time user, maximum-scale user. Naming the edge case explicitly is the difference between "I considered it" and actually having considered it.

### 6. First-Principles Thinking
Ask: am I recommending this because it's genuinely the right fundamental approach, or just because it's the conventional one? Strip away "that's how it's usually done" and check if the reasoning still holds.

### 7. Pre-Mortem
Ask: imagine this shipped and it failed in six months — what's the most believable reason? If you can name a plausible failure story, that risk is worth addressing now, not after it happens.

## When to surface it out loud

Run all seven every time (it's fast). Surface a finding explicitly only when:
- The decision is hard to reverse (architecture, schema, public API, auth, firmware protocol)
- The user is choosing between options and the real tradeoff isn't obvious yet
- The pre-mortem turns up a genuine failure mode worth a one-line flag
- Edge cases would change the recommendation

When surfacing, keep it to one sentence or a short bullet folded into the answer — not a labeled seven-part report.

## Application by role

| สาย | Most critical checks |
|---|---|
| Embedded / Firmware | Edge cases (boundary conditions, interrupt timing) + Pre-mortem (what if OTA fails?) |
| IoT Architect | Holistic (device to cloud system) + Cover all bases (offline behavior) |
| Solutions Architect | First-principles (is this truly the right stack?) + Pre-mortem (vendor risk) |
| Product Manager | Consider all use cases (edge-case personas) + Holistic (does this conflict with roadmap?) |
| UX Writer | Consider all use cases (error state, empty state, first-time user) |
| Prompt Engineering | Edge cases (adversarial input) + Pre-mortem (agent over-acts) |
